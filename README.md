# A video game

This repository holds the source and assets for some video game we are making.  

# Documentation [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/crazyleegame/badge/?version=latest)](http://crazyleegame.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Information for developing or playing will be available on [ReadTheDocs](), and hopefully that badge will stay green :smile:.
